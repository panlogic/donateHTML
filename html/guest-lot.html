		<h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
		<p>We have 21 oak benches in this style that were made about 30 years ago, their shape and form an evocation of Stuart benches of 400 years ago. These benches have served visitors well, providing a place to contemplate, enjoy and be shielded in the garden. Most of the benches are in desperate need of repair and two need replacing now. If possible, we would like to provide more of these beautiful oak benches for visitors here. They are made in pairs. A pair costs &pound;3620. Mending 19 existing benches that are on display would cost about &pound;8000. Can you please help us with this project, and come and enjoy these restored benches in the next years?</p>
					<p>We are also saving for return of our plinths and statues in the Wilderness. Mercury and Fortuna are on display, and Venus de Medici and Cleopatra are ready to grace the Wilderness again.</p>
					<p>The National Trust urgently needs to raise funds for Ham's benches, statues, plinths and for other charitable projects. Thank you for your support.</p>

					<ol><li>Auction<br>The online auction is operated for the benefit of the Recipient Charity for whom the Auction is being run. Normally the Recipient Charity is donating the item and the Host is simply providing the technology and system for you to bid on such item. Bidders may bid for more than one Item in the Auction. The winning bidder on each Item offered for sale in the course of the Auction will be the person who has submitted the highest bid at the notified deadline and providing it is in excess of any stated reserve.</li><li>Eligible Bidders<br>All bidders must be capable of forming legally binding relations under applicable law. The Auction may not be used by individuals under the age of 18 years old and by any other persons who are legally prohibited from, or otherwise incapable of, entering into binding contracts. Any bidder using the Auction is warranting by so doing that they are legally entitled to do so. As bidder you agree that we can process your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy specifically for this Auction. We do not and will not store your credit or debit card details beyond taking payment during this Auction.</li><li>Bidding<br>Bidders wishing to bid on an Item may make a bid for an Item through the Auction. All Items offered in an Auction are listed and offered for sale on an "as is" basis. Bidders are advised to conduct any research or due diligence on an Item prior to making a bid. Any questions or concerns should be addressed to the Recipient Charity at hello@nationalfundingscheme.org A bid made by a bidder is an offer to purchase the Item listed at the stated bid price. Any bidder making a bid for an Item acknowledges and agrees that their offer is an irrevocable offer to complete the transaction if they are the winning bidder whereupon the bid will become a contractually binding obligation to purchase the Item at the bid price. If a bidder bids on an Item and that bid represents the winning bid for that Item and the winning bid is above or equal to the reserve, the bidder's bid is deemed accepted. The 'winning bidder' is the person certified by the Host at the end of the Auction to be the highest bidder, provided that their bid meets the reserve. The winning bidder may include any under-bidder who is awarded the Item following the failure of a higher bid for any reason.</li><li>Item Descriptions<br>Items for sale in the Auction are listed on the site with a description and a minimum bid. The Recipient Charity will, wherever possible, provide a representational image of the Item offered for sale in the Auction but shall have no liability if it does not do so. All Images are subject to copyright of the artist. Whilst the Recipient Charity strives to ensure that descriptions and photographs are accurate, complete and up-to-date, it does not guarantee that this is the case, and will not be responsible for any damage or loss caused due to a bidder by reason of a description of an Item being inaccurate, incomplete or for the Item being otherwise in any way different to the bidder's expectation. Descriptions of Items are provided without a warranty of any kind. In no event shall the Recipient Charity (including its employees, affiliates and volunteers) be liable for any claim, demand or damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use by the bidder of the site, the Auction or their purchase and use of an Item. The Recipient Charity reserves the right in its absolute discretion to amend or change the Item due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control.</li><li>Bidding and Payment Deadlines<br>Deadlines for receipt of bids made for an Item offered in the Auction are at the sole discretion of the Recipient Charity and the Host and will not be extended under any circumstances. No bids will be accepted on an Item after the deadline. After the Auction closes the Host will contact the winning bidder by email to inform the bidder that their bid was the highest and that they are, therefore, the winning bidder. The winning bidder must make payment for the Item within 5 calendar days or as the Recipient Charity in its absolute discretion directs and any failure to make payment within the Recipient Charity’s deadline entitles the Recipient Charity to award the Item to the next highest bidder and the original winner will have no right to insist on receiving the Item.</li><li>Gift Aid<br>By agreeing to Gift Aid, the bidder is confirming they have paid or will pay an amount of Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax for the current year that is at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities that the bidder donates to will reclaim on their gifts for the current tax year. The bidder understands that other taxes such as VAT and Council Tax do not qualify. The bidder understands the Recipient Charity will reclaim 25p of tax on every £1 that is given. Gift Aid on lot items is only applicable in a limited number of situations; the Recipient Charity will claim wherever possible; for more info see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/charities/gift_aid/rules/auctions.htm.</li><li>Fees<br>The Host charge the Recipient Charity a small fee for marketing, running and providing the system to allow the Auction to happen and this is equal to or less than 10%. All remaining monies are donated to the Recipient Charity. Some Items offered for sale on the site may be subject to a reserve. All monies paid less the reserve and any fee by a winning bidder will be donated to the Charities.</li><li>Applicable Law<br>This Agreement between you the bidder and the Recipient Charity shall be interpreted and construed in all respects in accordance with English law and any dispute arising in relation to any aspect of the use of the Auction, the Bidding System, bids made by a bidder in the course of an Auction, any Item, payment delivery or any other matter relating to the Auction shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts to which the parties hereby irrevocably submit.</li><li>Variation of Terms<br>These Terms and Conditions may be revised and updated by the Recipient Charity and or Host from time to time without notice. Bidders who have previously bid in the Recipient Charity Auction are accordingly advised to familiarise themselves with the prevailing edition of these Terms and Conditions when deciding to participate in an Auction. Notwithstanding the foregoing the edition of the Terms and Conditions that was current at the time an Auction commenced will continue to apply throughout that Auction and to all Items sold pursuant to it even if later edition of the Terms and Conditions is implemented before the Auction is completed.</li><li>Third Party Rights<br>No person who is not a party to an Agreement shall have any right pursuant to the terms of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of such Agreement.</li><li>Shipping Policy<br>Where delivery of an Item to a bidder is required then the Recipient Charity will use reasonable endeavours to ship the Item to the bidder within 21 days of the Auction ending unless otherwise notified by the Recipient Charity in the Item description or otherwise.</li></ol>
